# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 0 : July 6 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I have setup Tensorflow but now I have to develope some skills to start work on project. So Siraj Tensorflow videos opting as refrence.

**Thoughts** : Machine Learning is like 

> *You dive into the water, but you can't see how deep it is.*

## Day 1 : July 7 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : My 2nd day of **100DaysOfMLCode** & today I finished Chapter 1 of Machine Learning by Prof. John Paisley. I learned about SUPERVISED and UNSUPERVISED LEARNING and a lot of Mathematical Stuff which I thought waste of time but I have to practice them again.

**Thoughts** : Every thing is in slabous just because of reason. Today I feel respect for my Mathematics faculty.

## Day 2 : July 8 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Learning more about supervised and unsupervised Learning.


## Day 3 : July 9 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Mathematics used in Machine Learning Coursera . Learn about how Linear Algebra influences Machine Learning.
