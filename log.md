# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 0 : July 6 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I have setup Tensorflow but now I have to develope some skills to start work on project. So Siraj Tensorflow videos opting as refrence.

**Thoughts** : Machine Learning is like 

> *You dive into the water, but you can't see how deep it is.*

## Day 1 : July 7 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : My 2nd day of **100DaysOfMLCode** & today I finished Chapter 1 of Machine Learning by Prof. John Paisley. I learned about SUPERVISED and UNSUPERVISED LEARNING and a lot of Mathematical Stuff which I thought waste of time but I have to practice them again.

**Thoughts** : Every thing is in slabous just because of reason. Today I feel respect for my Mathematics faculty.

## Day 2 : July 8 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Learning more about supervised and unsupervised Learning.


## Day 3 : July 9 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Mathematics used in Machine Learning Coursera . Learn about how Linear Algebra influences Machine Learning.



## Day 4 : July 10 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : First time I use PyTorch and working on Deep Learning. I used the docs available at the website. I did some exercise which is presented in the PyTorch Exercise Folder.

## Day 5 : July 11 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Read Research paper of Morse Code Datasets for Machine Learning(Looking Forward to work on this topic in future. [Research Paper link](https://nurture.ai/p/4a587115-6bbb-4ef9-b44c-96effcf467b2)

## Day 6 : July 12 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Recently learning about Computational Linear Algebra will continue with it and do some small projects .

Will be continue.....
