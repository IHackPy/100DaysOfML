## Day 1 : July 7 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : My 2nd day of **100DaysOfMLCode** & today I finished Chapter 1 of Machine Learning by Prof. John Paisley. I learned about SUPERVISED and UNSUPERVISED LEARNING and a lot of Mathematical Stuff which I thought waste of time but I have to practice them again.

**Thoughts** : Every thing is in slabous just because of reason. Today I feel respect for my Mathematics faculty.
